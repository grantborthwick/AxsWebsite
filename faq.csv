question,answer
"Aren't fraternities just for men?","Although most fraternities for women call themselves sororities, fraternity is the more general term for a greek letter organization. We are a fraternity in the true sense of the word. All members are referred to as brothers, including our female members."
"What is a professional faternity?","A professional fraternity selects its members based on common professional goals and interests. The more common social fraternities choose their members based on similar social interests. However, professional fraternities can have just as much fun as social ones, just ask any one of our members."
"What is pledging?",You can join some organizations simply by filling out a form and mailing in your dues. Joining a fraternity is more work. Pledging is a process where a potential member associates with our fraternity for several months before becoming a brother. This gives both you and us a chance to get to know each other before we mutually agree that our fraternity is a good fit for you.
"Does AΧΣ Haze?","Absolutely not. As a professional fraternity, we have a zero-tolerance policy on hazing. Pledges who are uncomfortable with what is asked of them by a member of the fraternity should voice their concerns and, if necessary, report the matter to one of the fraternity officers."
"Is pledging fun?","We certainly hope so. If you don't enjoy pledging, you won't enjoy being a member either. If, unfortunately, you view coming to fraternity meetings and events a hassle rather than a time for fun, perhaps you might reconsider joining our fraternity."
"How much of a time commitment is pledging?","Expect to spend a minimum of three or four hours per week with your potential brothers and fellow pledges. We have mandatory pledge meetings once a week and recommended activities on some weekends. The time commitment is more than that to join most clubs, but much less than that to join a social fraternity. We will not wake you up at 5am to do push ups! The time commitment for pledging is meant to be the same as for a minimally active member. If you don't have time to pledge, you wont have time to be a member. All that being said, many pledges find themselves voluntarily spending more time with Alpha Chi Sigma than required. It's fun you'll see!"
"What will I do as a pledge?","As a pledge you will have a 'big,' an active member to act as mentor and help you through the pledging process. You'll have to learn a little about the fraternities history and alchemy (yes, you will be quizzed). Mostly though, you will be having fun and learning what brotherhood is all about. Pledge events include bowling, a potluck, trivia night, AΧΣ Jeopardy, and many more!"
"Can I be a member of another fraternity or sorority if I join AΧΣ?","Since we are the only chemistry fraternity on campus, the answer is yes. In fact, several of our brothers are also in social fraternities and sororities."
"Is AΧΣ only at K-State?","No! There are about 50 chapters of AΧΣ all across the United States. Here's a <a href='http://www.alphachisigma.org'>link</a> to the national web-site, and here's a <a href='http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=262'>link</a> to a list of our chapters."
"I'm a grad student. Why would I want to associate with undergrads?","Well, first of all, we are not only undergrads. Many of our active members are graduate students. In fact, many professors are also AΧΣ brothers. Since we are a professional fraternity, we also have an active presence in industry and a number of professional chapters. AΧΣ is not just for undergrads, it's for life."
